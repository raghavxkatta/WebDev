    <div><h2>My Mother's Day message for you</h2></div>
    <p>You've always been the light of my sunshine. Doing ridiculous amount of work just to make our future bright. Facing countless issues on a daily basis and tackling them with your 'art are al!' smile. Keeping a stone on heart and still doing things so that our fam stays happy. I might not ever be able to repay the things you've done for me and our family but I would try my best to be just like you. Be it the scrumptious food you make or the slashing you give eventually gives us happiness. However hard you r, ik for sure the motherly love within you turns everything into a soft landing. You had times when all you saw was darkness around you but the light with in you was so intense that you overcome those hurdles with a 2 dimple smile on you face. I don't know about others but the way you've crystallised the bond between us ik for sure that no amount of heat can melt it.</p>

    Subject: A Letter to My Dearest Mom

    Dear Mom,
    
    As I sit down to write this letter, I am filled with an overwhelming sense of gratitude and love for you. There are so many things I want to express, but words seem inadequate to capture the depth of my feelings for you.
    
    Mom, you are the cornerstone of our family, the source of endless love, support, and wisdom. From the moment I came into this world, you have been by my side, guiding me with your gentle touch and unwavering devotion. Your selflessness knows no bounds, and your sacrifices have shaped me into the person I am today.
    
    I want to thank you for all the times you stayed up late to comfort me when I was sick, for the countless meals you prepared with love, and for the infinite hugs that made everything feel better. Your kindness and compassion have been a beacon of light in my darkest moments, reminding me that I am never alone.
    
    But beyond your acts of caregiving, Mom, it is your strength and resilience that inspire me the most. You have faced challenges with grace and dignity, never once allowing adversity to dim your spirit. Your unwavering faith in the face of life's trials has taught me the power of perseverance and the importance of never losing hope.
    
    Mom, as I navigate through life's twists and turns, I find solace in knowing that you are always there, cheering me on from the sidelines. Your unconditional love is my guiding star, illuminating my path and giving me the courage to chase my dreams.
    
    On this day, and every day, I want you to know how much you mean to me. You are not just my mother; you are my hero, my confidante, and my best friend. I am blessed beyond measure to have you in my life, and I cherish every moment we share together.
    
    Thank you, Mom, for your boundless love, your unwavering support, and your endless sacrifices. You are the heartbeat of our family, and I am eternally grateful for the gift of your presence in my life.
    
    With all my love and admiration,
Yours Raghav
